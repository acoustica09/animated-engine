This example shows a piano on screen that players can
play with their keyboard. It uses pre-made sound files
for every piano key.

6.1 Piano is a World and Key is an Actor of piano keys.
6.8 Both keys play the sound. I think we will have to make certain keys
    a certain sound, so make one key play with they key "g", another
    with key "a" and so on.
6.16 I think we can use the value of "i" to move the keys some amount to
     the right by multiplying "i" to the width 63.
6.17 The loop executes 12 times. The values of i throughout the loop are:
     0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
